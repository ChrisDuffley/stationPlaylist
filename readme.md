# StationPlaylist #

* Authors: Christopher Duffley <nvda@chrisduffley.com> (formerly Joseph Lee <joseph.lee22590@gmail.com>, originally by Geoff Shang and other contributors)

This add-on package provides improved usage of StationPlaylist Studio and other StationPlaylist apps, as well as providing utilities to control Studio from anywhere. Supported apps include Studio, Creator, Track Tool, VT Recorder, and Streamer, as well as SAM, SPL, and AltaCast encoders.

For more information about the add-on, read the [add-on guide][1].

IMPORTANT NOTES:

* This add-on requires StationPlaylist suite 6.0 or later.
* Some add-on features will be disabled or limited if NVDA is running in secure mode such as in logon screen.
* For best experience, disable audio ducking mode.
* Starting from 2018, [changelogs for old add-on releases][2] will be found on GitHub. This add-on readme will list changes from version 25.01 (2025) onwards.
* While Studio is running, you can save, reload saved settings, or reset add-on settings to defaults by pressing Control+NVDA+C, Control+NVDA+R once, or Control+NVDA+R three times, respectively. This is also applicable to encoder settings - you can save and reset (not reload) encoder settings if using encoders.
* Many commands will provide speech output while NVDA is in speak on demand mode (NVDA 2024.1 and later).

## Shortcut keys

Most of these will work in Studio only unless otherwise specified. Unless noted otherwise, these commands support speak on demand mode.

## Unassigned commands

The following commands are not assigned by default; if you wish to assign them, use Input Gestures dialog to add custom commands. To do so, from Studio window, open NVDA menu, Preferences, then Input Gestures. Expand StationPlaylist category, then locate unassigned commands from the list below and select "Add", then type the gesture you wish to use.

Important: some of these commands will not work if NVDA is running in secure mode such as from login screen. Not all commands support speak on demand.

## SPL Controller

The SPL Controller is a set of layered commands you can use to control SPL Studio anywhere. Press the SPL Controller layer command, and NVDA will say, "SPL Controller." Press another command to control various Studio settings such as microphone on/off or play the next track. You can also configure NVDA to enter SPL Assistant layer (see above) by pressing SPL Controller layer command (passthrough mode, enabled by default).

Important: SPL Controller layer commands are disabled if NVDA is running in secure mode.

Outside of Studio, the available SPL Controller commands are (some commands support speak on demand):

* P: Play the next selected track.
* U: Pause or unpause playback.
* S: Stop the track with fade out.

* C: Title and duration of the currently playing track (supports speak on demand).
* Shift+C: Title and duration of the upcoming track if any (supports speak on demand).
* E: Encoder connection status (supports speak on demand).
* I: Listener count (supports speak on demand).
* Q: Studio status information such as whether a track is playing, microphone is on and others (supports speak on demand).
* Cart keys (F1, Control+1, for example): Play assigned carts from anywhere.
* H: Layer help.

From inside Studio, SPL Controller layer command will invoke SPL Assistant layer by default.

## Track and microphone alarms

By default, NVDA will play a beep if five seconds are left in the track (outro) and/or intro, as well as to hear a beep if microphone has been active for a while. To configure track and microphone alarms, press Alt+NVDA+1 to open alarms settings in Studio add-on settings screen. You can also use this screen to configure if you'll hear a beep, a message or both when alarms are turned on.

## Track Finder

If you wish to quickly find a song by an artist or by song name, from track list, press Control+NVDA+F. Type or choose the name of the artist or the song name. NVDA will either place you at the song if found or will display an error if it cannot find the song you're looking for. To find a previously entered song or artist, press NVDA+F3 or NVDA+Shift+F3 to find forward or backward.

Note: Track Finder is case-sensitive.

## Cart Explorer

Depending on edition, SPL Studio allows up to 96 carts to be assigned for playback. NVDA allows you to hear which cart, or jingle is assigned to these commands.

To learn cart assignments, from SPL Studio, press Alt+NVDA+3. Pressing the cart command once will tell you which jingle is assigned to the command. Pressing the cart command twice will play the jingle. Press Alt+NVDA+3 to exit cart explorer. See the add-on guide for more information on cart explorer.

## Track time analysis

To obtain length to play selected tracks, mark current track for start of track time analysis (SPL Assistant, F9), then press SPL Assistant, F10 when reaching end of selection.

## Columns Explorer

By pressing Control+NVDA+1 through 0, you can obtain contents of specific columns. By default, these are first ten columns for a track item (in Studio: artist, title, duration, intro, outro, category, year, album, genre, mood). In Studio, Creator's main track list and playlist editor, Track Tool, and Remote VT, column slots are preset regardless of column order on screen and can be configured from add-on settings dialog under columns explorer category.

## Track column announcement

You can ask NVDA to announce track columns found in Studio's playlist viewer in the order it appears on screen or using a custom order and/or exclude certain columns. Press NVDA+V to toggle this behavior while focused on a track in Studio's playlist viewer. To customize column inclusion and order, from column announcement settings panel in add-on settings, uncheck "Announce columns in the order shown on screen" and then customize included columns and/or column order.

## Playlist snapshots

You can press SPL Assistant, F8 while focused on a playlist in Studio to obtain various statistics about a playlist, including number of tracks in the playlist, longest track, top artists and so on. After assigning a custom command for this feature, pressing the custom command twice will cause NVDA to present playlist snapshot information as a webpage so you can use browse mode to navigate (press escape to close).

## Playlist Transcripts

Pressing SPL Assistant, Shift+F8 will present a dialog to let you request playlist transcripts in numerous formats, including in a plain text format, an HTML table or a list.

## Configuration dialog

From studio window, you can press Alt+NVDA+0 to open the add-on configuration dialog. Alternatively, go to NVDA's preferences menu and select SPL Studio Settings item. Not all settings are available if NVDA is running in secure mode.

## Broadcast profiles dialog

You can save settings for specific shows into broadcast profiles. These profiles can be managed via SPL broadcast profiles dialog which can be accessed by pressing Alt+NVDA+P from Studio window.

## SPL touch mode

If you are using Studio on a touchscreen computer with NVDA installed, you can perform some Studio commands from the touchscreen. First use three finger tap to switch to SPL mode, then use the touch commands listed above to perform commands.

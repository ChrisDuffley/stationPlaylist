## Version 25.08/25.06.5-LTS

* 25.08: removed unmaintained localizations (add-on messages and documentation).
* In Studio, added two-finger flick left gesture in SPL touch mode to open SPL add-on settings.
* Removed "Status" from vertical column navigation options.
* In columns explorer (Studio, Track Tool, Creator, Remote VT), NVDA will no longer announce "blank" for empty column content (only column header will be announced).
* In Studio, Track Tool, Creator, and Remote VT, NVDA will announce track position and count when location command is performed (NVDA+Numpad Delete (desktop)/NVDA+Delete (laptop) and adding Shift for review cursor version).

## Version 25.07.2/25.06.4-LTS

* Restored missing localized messages including track comment announcement in Studio's playlist viewer.
* NVDA will present an error dialog when running Studio releases earlier than the version required for the add-on.
* In Studio, pressing NVDA+Shift+F3 the first time without opening find dialog will cause NVDA to search backwards.
* In Track Tool, NVDA will no longer play a beep when moving through tracks, especially for tracks without an intro set.

## Version 25.07.1/25.06.3-LTS

* In Studio's playlist viewer, NVDA will no longer appear to do nothing or play error tones when reporting column contents if vertical column navigation is set to values other than "whichever column I am reviewing".
* Setting vertical column navigation to "Status" column is deprecated and will be removed in a future add-on release.

## Version 25.07/25.06.2-LTS

Version 25.07 supports SPL Studio 6.0 and later.

* 25.07: code was refactored, including through use of Pyright (a Python static type checker). Some prominent code changes were also backported to 25.06.2-LTS.
* Columns explorer (Control+NVDA+number row) is now configurable for Creator and Remote VT's playlist editor. A new button, "columns explorer for playlist editor" is available from columns explorer add-on settings screen.

* Track columns viewer command (Control+NVDA+hyphen) is now available in Creator's Playlist Editor and Remote VT.
* Track columns viewer command will respect column order displayed on screen.
* In SAM encoders, improved NVDA's responsiveness when pressing Control+F9 or Control+F10 to connect or disconnect all encoders, respectively. This may result in increased verbosity when announcing the selected encoder information.
* In SPL and AltaCast encoders, pressing F9 will now connect the selected encoder.

## Version 20.07

* In Studio's playlist viewer, NVDA will no longer appear to do nothing or play error tones when attempting to delete tracks or after clearing the loaded playlist while focused on playlist viewer.

* As audio ducking feature in NVDA does not impact streaming from Studio except for specific hardware setups, audio ducking reminder dialog has been removed.
* When errors are found in encoder settings, it is no longer necessary to switch to Studio window to let NVDA reset settings to defaults. You must now switch to an encoder from encoders window to let NVDA reset encoder settings.
* The title of encoder settings dialog for SAM encoders now displays encoder format rather than encoder position.

## Version 20.05

* Initial support for Remote VT (voice track) client, including remote playlist editor with same commands as Creator's playlist editor.
* Commands used to open separate alarm settings dialogs (Alt+NVDA+1, Alt+NVDA+2, Alt+NVDA+4) has been combined into Alt+NVDA+1 and will now open alarms settings in SPL add-on settings screen where track outro/intro and microphone alarm settings can be found.
* In triggers dialog found in broadcast profiles dialog, removed the user interface associated with time-based broadcast profiles feature such as profile switch day/time/duration fields.
* Profile switch countdown setting found in broadcast profiles dialog has been removed.
* As Window-Eyes is no longer supported by Vispero since 2017, SPL Assistant command layout for Window-Eyes is deprecated and will be removed in a future add-on release. A warning will be shown at startup urging users to change SPL Assistant command layout to NVDA (default) or JAWS.
* When using Columns Explorer slots (Control+NVDA+number row commands) or column navigation commands (Control+Alt+home/end/left arrow/right arrow) in Creator and Remote VT client, NVDA will no longer announce wrong column data after changing column position on screen via mouse.
* In encoders and Streamer, NVDA will no longer appear to do nothing or play error tones when exiting NVDA while focused on something other than encoders list without moving focus to encoders first.

## Version 20.04

* Time-based broadcast profiles feature is deprecated. A warning message will be shown when first starting Studio after installing add-on 20.04 if you have defined one or more time-based broadcast profiles.
* Broadcast profiles management has been split from SPL add-on settings dialog into its own dialog. You can access broadcast profiles dialog by pressing Alt+NVDA+P from Studio window.
* Due to duplication with Control+NVDA+number row commands for Studio tracks, columns explorer commands from SPL Assistant (number row) has been removed.

* NVDA will no longer play error tones or appear to do nothing when clicking OK button from Columns Explorer dialog after configuring column slots.
* In encoders, you can now save and reset encoder settings (including stream labels) by pressing Control+NVDA+C or Control+NVDA+R three times, respectively.

## Version 20.03

* Columns Explorer will now announce first ten columns by default (existing installations will continue to use old column slots).
* The ability to announce name of the playing track automatically from places other than Studio has been removed. This feature, introduced in add-on 5.6 as a workaround for Studio 5.1x, is no longer functional. Users must now use SPL Controller and/or Assistant layer command to hear title of the currently playing track from everywhere (C).
* Due to removal of automatic announcement of playing track title, the setting to configure this feature has been removed from add-on settings/status announcement category.
* In encoders, NVDA will play connection tone every half a second while an encoder is connecting.
* In encoders, NVDA will now announce connection attempt messages until an encoder is actually connected. Previously NVDA stopped when an error was encountered.

## Version 18.10

* NVDA 2018.3 or later is required.
* Internal changes to make the add-on more compatible with Python 3.

## Version 18.09.1-LTS

* When obtaining playlist transcripts in HTML table format, column headers are no longer rendered as a Python list string.

## Version 18.09-LTS

Version 18.09.x is the last release series to support Studio 5.10 and based on old technologies, with 18.10 and later supporting Studio 5.11/5.20 and new features. Some new features will be backported to 18.09.x if needed.

* NVDA 2018.3 or later is recommended due to introduction of wxPython 4.
* Add-on settings screen is now fully based on multi-page interface derived from NVDA 2018.2 and later.

## Version 18.08

* Add-on settings dialog is now based on multi-category settings interface found in NVDA 2018.2. Consequently, this release requires NVDA 2018.2 or later. The old add-on settings interface is deprecated and will be removed later in 2018.
* Added a new section (button/panel) in add-on settings to configure playlist transcripts options, which is used to configure column inclusion and ordering for this feature and other settings.
* When creating a table-based playlist transcripts and if custom column ordering and/or column removal is in effect, NVDA will use custom column presentation order specified from add-on settings and/or not include information from removed columns.
* When using column navigation commands in track items (Control+Alt+home/end/left arrow/right arrow) in Studio, Creator, and Track Tool, NVDA will no longer announce wrong column data after changing column position on screen via mouse.
* Significant improvements to NVDA's responsiveness when using column navigation commands in Creator and Track Tool. In particular, when using Creator, NVDA will respond better when using column navigation commands.
* NVDA will no longer play error tones or appear to do nothing when attempting to add comments to tracks in Studio or when exiting NVDA while using Studio, caused by wxPython 4 compatibility issue.

## Version 18.07

* Added an experimental multi-category add-on settings screen, accessible by toggling a setting in add-on settings/Advanced dialog (you need to restart NVDA after configuring this setting for the new dialog to show up). This is for NVDA 2018.2 users, and not all add-on settings can be configured from this new screen.
* NVDA will no longer play error tones or appear to do nothing when trying to rename a broadcast profile from add-on settings, caused by wxPython 4 compatibility issue.
* When restarting NVDA and/or Studio after making changes to settings in a broadcast profile other than normal profile, NVDA will no longer revert to old settings.
* It is now possible to obtain playlist transcripts for the current hour. Select "current hour" from list of playlist range options in playlist transcripts dialog (SPL Assistant, Shift+F8).
* Added an option in Playlist Transcripts dialog to have transcripts saved to a file (all formats) or copied to the clipboard (text and Markdown table formats only) in addition to viewing transcripts on screen. When transcripts are saved, they are saved to user's Documents folder under "nvdasplPlaylistTranscripts" subfolder.
* Status column is no longer included when creating playlist transcripts in HTML and Markdown table formats.
* When focused on a track in Creator and Track Tool, pressing Control+NVDA+number row twice will present column information on a browse mode window.

* While opening a find dialog from Studio and an unexpected error occurs, NVDA will present more appropriate messages instead of saying that another find dialog is open.
* In encoders window, NVDA will no longer play error tones or appear to do nothing when attempting to open encoder settings dialog (Alt+NVDA+0).

## Version 18.06

* In add-on settings, added "Apply" button so changes to settings can be applied to the currently selected and/or active profile without closing the dialog first. This feature is available for NVDA 2018.2 users.
* Resolved an issue where NVDA would apply changes to Columns Explorer settings despite pressing Cancel button from add-on settings dialog.
* In Studio, when pressing Control+NVDA+number row twice while focused on a track, NVDA will display column information for a specific column on a browse mode window.
* While focused on a track in Studio, pressing Control+NVDA+Dash will display data for all columns on a browse mode window.
* In StationPlaylist Creator, when focused on a track, pressing Control+NVDA+number row will announce data in specific column.
* Added a button in Studio add-on settings to configure Columns Explorer for SPL Creator.
* Added Markdown table format as a playlist transcripts format.
* The developer feedback email command has changed from Control+NVDA+dash to Alt+NVDA+dash.

## Version 18.05

* Added ability to take partial playlist snapshots. This can be done by defining analysis range (SPL Assistant, F9 at the start of the analysis range) and moving to another item and performing playlist snapshots command.
* Added a new command in SPL Assistant to request playlist transcripts in a number of formats (Shift+F8). These include plain text, an HTML table, or an HTML list.
* Various playlist analysis features such as track time analysis and playlist snapshots are now grouped under the theme of "Playlist Analyzer".

## Version 18.04.1

* NVDA will no longer fail to start countdown timer for time-based broadcast profiles if NVDA with wxPython 4 toolkit installed is in use.

## Version 18.04

* Changes were made to make add-on update check feature more reliable, particularly if automatic add-on update check is enabled.
* NVDA will play a tone to indicate start of library scan when it is configured to play beeps for various announcements.
* NVDA will start library scan in the background if library scan is started from Studio's Options dialog or at startup.
* Double-tapping on a track on a touchscreen computer or performing default action command will now select the track and move system focus to it.
* When taking playlist snapshots (SPL Assistant, F8), if a playlist consists of hour markers only, resolves several issues where NVDA appeared to not take snapshots.

## Version 18.03/15.14-LTS

* If NVDA is configured to announce metadata streaming status when Studio starts, NVDA will honor this setting and no longer announce streaming status when switching to and from instant switch profiles.
* If switching to and from an instant switch profile and NVDA is configured to announce metadata streaming status whenever this happens, NVDA will no longer announce this information multiple times when switching profiles quickly.
* NVDA will remember to switch to the appropriate time-based profile (if defined for a show) after NVDA restarts multiple times during broadcasts.
* If a time-based profile with profile duration set is active and when add-on settings dialog is opened and closed, NVDA will still switch back to the original profile once the time-based profile is finished.
* If a time-based profile is active (particularly during broadcasts), changing broadcast profile triggers via add-on settings dialog will not be possible.

## Version 18.02/15.13-LTS

* 18.02: Due to internal changes made to support extension points and other features, NVDA 2017.4 is required.
* Add-on updating won't be possible under some cases. These include running NVDA from source code or with secure mode turned on. Secure mode check is applicable to 15.13-LTS as well.

* You can now press cart keys (F1, for example) after entering SPl Controller layer to play assigned carts from anywhere.
* Due to changes introduced in wxPython 4 GUI toolkit, stream label eraser dialog is now a combo box instead of a number entry field.

## Version 17.11.2

This is the last stable version to support Windows XP, Vista and 7 without Service Pack 1. The next stable version for these Windows releases will be a 15.x LTS release.

* If using Windows releases prior to Windows 7 Service Pack 1, you cannot switch to development channels.

## Version 17.11.1/15.11-LTS

* NVDA will no longer play error tones or appear to do nothing when using Control+Alt+left or right arrow keys to navigate columns in Track Tool 5.20 with a track loaded. Because of this change, when using Studio 5.20, build 48 or later is required.

## Version 17.11/15.10-LTS
